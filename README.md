# NextFlix

This is Netflix clone Built with Next js, React, and Tailwind CSS. The Goal of this project isn't to exploit/pirate Copyright content but to learn by doing, I wanted to make something that wasn't just for the looks or 'Form over Function'.

# Here are some screenshots of the app

## Git Setup 

If you want to clone this you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine then, pick a directory where you want it to be stored, open terminal or CMD/PowerShell in that directory and run `git clone https://github.com/shishantbiswas/nextflix.git` this will clone the content of the main branch to your system now you can write `code .` within the same terminal or CMD/PowerShell instance and develop the project as per you need.

### Everything below is added by Next Js 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started



First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Poppins, a Google Font.
